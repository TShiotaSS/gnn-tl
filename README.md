# gnn_tf

This library provides a platform for using trained NNP graph neural networks as descriptors. 

For more details on the methodology, please refer to the reference section.

# Installing via Docker

Execute the following command in the directory where docker-compose.yml is located.
A docker image will be created, referring to the Dockerfile.
```
docker-compose build
``` docker-compose build

Run the following command in the directory containing docker-compose.yml.
```
docker-compose up
```

# Example 

Please refer to the notebook in the /gnn_tf/example.

# Requirements
