# gnn_tf

This environment provides a platform for using trained NNP graph neural networks as descriptors. 

For more details on the methodology, please refer to the reference section.

# Installing via Docker

We provide a user-friendly container environment with Docker and Jupyter Lab to avoid cumbersome dependencies and environment construction costs.

Execute the following command in the directory where docker-compose.yml is located.
A docker image will be created, referring to the Dockerfile.
```
docker-compose build
```

Run the following command in the directory containing docker-compose.yml.
```
docker-compose up
```

Then, run the following command in some browser. you can connect to the Docker container through Jupyter Lab. The settings are in docker-compose.yml.
```
http://localhost:18080
``` 

# Tutorial 

Please refer to the notebook in the /gnn_tf/tutorial.
